<h1>The Best Movies According to Dias</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>I like this movie because it shows the fragility of human and the friendship you form with others.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: Across The Spider-verse</h3>
<p>This movie has great visuals and groundbreaking animation style. I like the storyline and can't wait for the final movie.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
<p>This movie opens up multiversal Spider-Man in the MCU. I like this movie cause it resets MCU's Spider-Man, to be his own man, and build himself from zero.</p>
